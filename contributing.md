You built a system according to the LA? Gave a talk on the LA? Have a project up
on GitHub that contributes to the LA? Brilliant! Here is how you can share this 
with the community and make the world a better place:

Fork us on [GitHub](https://github.com/mhausenblas/lambda-architecture.net) and
create a pull request with the suggested changes. Either Nathan or Michael will 
review and apply then. We are using Jekyll as basis for this platform so you
might want to first [check it out](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html)
before you pull the trigger.

Alternatively, if you're not familiar with GitHub and/or Jekyll you may want to
[raise an issue](https://github.com/mhausenblas/lambda-architecture.net/issues)
describing what you want to see added to the site. Please note that in this case
it can take a while until one of us has the time to review and implement your
proposal, so pull requests are certainly preferred.
