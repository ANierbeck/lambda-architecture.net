| | Only recently Nathan Marz [tweeted](https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/statuses/474719736878481408) that now all chapters of his Big Data book are available. Writing a book is already challenging, but writing a book and establishing a [startup](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/my-new-startup.html) at the same time certainly requires discipline and focus. So, big congrats to Nathan and his co-author James Warren for completing this important step! |
