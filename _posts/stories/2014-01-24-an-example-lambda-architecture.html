<p>
In this post it is shown how to use Trident, Hadoop and Splout SQL together to build a toy example “lambda architecture“. 
One can learn the basics of Trident, a higher-level API on top of Storm, and Splout SQL, a fast SQL read-only DB for Hadoop. 
The example architecture is hosted on <a href='https://github.com/pereferrera/trident-lambda-splout'>a github project</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The example simulates counting the number of appearances of hashtags in tweets, by date. 
The ultimate goal is to solve this simple problem in a fully scalable way, and provide a remote low-latency service for 
querying the evolution of the counts of a hashtag, including both consolidated and real-time statistics for it.
