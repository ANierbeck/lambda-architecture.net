<p>
At Metamarkets, we run a lambda architecture comprised of <a href='http://kafka.apache.org/'>Kafka</a>,
<a href='https://storm.incubator.apache.org/'>Storm</a>, <a href='http://hadoop.apache.org/'>Hadoop</a>, and
<a href='http://druid.io/'>Druid</a> to power interactive historical and real-time analysis of event streams. Around
the office, we tongue-in-cheekily call the setup the "RAD stack." It stands for "Real-time analytics data stack," you
see. As of this writing, the system handles some tens of billions of new events per day.
</p>

<p>
In our version of the architecture, Kafka acts as the origin data source for both real-time and batch pipelines. In
the real-time pipelines, Storm topologies read events from Kafka, process them, and stream them into Druid. In the
batch pipelines, all events are copied from Kafka to S3 and are then processed and loaded into Druid by a Hadoop flow
that applies the same logic as the Storm topology. We use a high-level abstraction to generate both the Hadoop and
Storm jobs, although it's also possible to write them independently.
</p>

<p>
Druid natively supports both real-time and batch ingestion, so we didn't need to implement anything extra to perform
aggregations or merge real-time and batch results. Once loaded into Druid, batch-ingested data automatically replaces
the data that was loaded in real-time for the same interval, providing a unified view.
