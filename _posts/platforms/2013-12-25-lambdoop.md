## Overview

Announced in fall 2013, [Lambdoop](http://www.lambdoop.com/) promises to 
provide a simple Java API for building Big Data applications using any 
processing paradigm: long-running (batch) tasks, streaming (real-time) 
processing and hybrid computation models (Lambda Architecture). As of 12/2013,
the folks from Treelogic that are driving the development of 
Lambdoop are working on their first release as Open Source, expected for Q1/2014.
