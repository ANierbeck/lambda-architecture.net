## Overview

In 09/2013 Twitter introduced [Summingbird](https://github.com/twitter/summingbird),
a library that lets you write streaming MapReduce programs that look like native
Scala or Java collection transformations and execute them on a number of 
well-known distributed MapReduce platforms like Storm and Scalding.
