## Overview

Buildoop is a tool similar to Apache BigTop but focused in the building of the Lambda
Architecture ecosystem. Buildoop is based on Groovy and JSON for recipe definitions.
This tool is heavily under development, in early stages of maturity, however has been
used for build a complete Linux Audit Framework analysis system based on Lambda Architecture.
